# *CS3345.501 Sorting Algorithm Analysis Application*


## Intro

Welcome to this Sorting Algorithm Analysis Application! This README will go over the various assumptions I made while putting together this application, as well as include analysis of the sorting algorithms performance.  
This includes the way I handled list creation, counting comparisons/movements, the winning algorithm, the reasons why CPU time doesn't factor in, and additional analysis of the sorting algorithms across the 4 list types.

## Creating Lists

All of the lists are created with for loops, and an additional for loop is used to create an Integer type list for use with the Heap class and sorting algorithm.

### Random List

The random list is made by casting numbers generated by Math.random.
