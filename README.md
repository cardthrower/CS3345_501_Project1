# *CS3345.501 Sorting Algorithm Analysis Application*


## Intro

Welcome to this Sorting Algorithm Analysis Application! This README will go over the various assumptions I made while putting together this application.  
This includes the way I handled list creation, counting comparisons/movements, the winning algorithm, the reasons why CPU time doesn't factor in, and additional analysis of the sorting algorithms across the 4 list types.
